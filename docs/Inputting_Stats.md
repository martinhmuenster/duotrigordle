# Inputting Statistics

Since Duotrigordle added statistics quite late, I've included the ability for you to manually input past games
in case you've been tracking them on your own.

## Adding games

To add past games to be recorded in the statistics:

1. Press "Add"
1. Enter the Daily Duotrigordle # for the game you'd like to record
1. Enter the number of guesses it took you to complete the game, or enter "X" if you failed to complete it in under 37 guesses
1. Enter the number of seconds it took you to complete the game (e.g. if you completed a game in 1:23.45, you should enter 83.45 into the box)
1. Repeat steps 2-4 until you've entered all your games

## Removing games

You may remove games if you entered something by mistake:

1. Press "Remove"
1. Enter the Daily Duotrigordle # for the game you wish to remove
1. Repeat step 2 until you've removed all the games you'd like to remove

## Listing games

Pressing "List" will list all the games recorded for statistics. Press "Ok" if you'd like to copy the
games to your clipboard (useful if the alert popup text is cut off), otherwise press "Cancel".
